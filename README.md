## Using AMPS and the Plugin SDK

Please consult our [Getting Started](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Getting+Started) documentation to learn how to build Atlassian Plugins. We also have a [quick-start tutorial](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Set+up+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK+and+Build+a+Project) for those who want to get stuck straight in to it.

## Reporting a Problem

If you're having problems with AMPS, please go to [Atlassian Developer Ecosystem Community](https://developer.atlassian.com/community/), our Q&A community site for the Atlassian Ecosystem, and ask for help. To report a bug, use the [AMPS JIRA Project][1]. If you're not sure if you've hit a bug, or just a usage problem, try the community site first!

### Rules of Engagement

If you want to submit bug fixes or improvements to AMPS, please assist us by adhering to these simple guidelines:

1. Do not commit directly to the primary branch. Please use a 'feature branch' from the main branch and then create a Pull Request for your changes to be accepted. The Server Ecosystem Engineering team will review and merge your work.
2. Create a JIRA Issue in the [AMPS JIRA Project][1] for any changes and prefix your commit messages with the relevant issue key.
3. You are responsible for testing and verifying your own changes. Yes, AMPS is a complex beast that must run on a variety of platforms against a variety of Atlassian products and must remain very backwards compatible and this means making changes can be difficult - please be diligent in this and help make life better for everyone who has to work on this project! :)

Atlassian developers, please see [The Platform Rules of Engagement (go/proe)](http://go.atlassian.com/proe).
